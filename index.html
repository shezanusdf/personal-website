        <h1>hi i'm shezan.</h1>
        <p>When COVID hit the world, I was just 12. At that age, the only thing that <br>
            excited me more than playing games was the idea of making money online.<br>
        </p>

        <p>The first money I ever made came from sneaker reselling. Back then,<br>
            it was the most popularized opportunity teens knew about.</p><p>I decided to start a small
            sneaker marketplace on Discord. Acted as<br> an escrow.. checked sneakers
            for authenticity, and earned a commision.<br>By the end of the first month, I had made around $500.
        </p>
        <p>Now.. i'm 17 years old and building cool sh*t w/ hackclub</p>
